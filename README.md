# Object Oriented Programming concepts

I compiled this repo based on questions I've been asked in interviews, and by speaking with other software engineers.

This repo includes concepts that come up often in conceptual technical interviews, such as:

#### 4 pillars of OOP
#### SOLID Principles
#### Architectural styles
#### HTTP request methods
#### Much more!
