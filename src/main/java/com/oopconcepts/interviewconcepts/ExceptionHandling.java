/*
* Exception handling in software development allows developers to handle errors that may occur within a program.

Exception handling is comprised of 3 code blocks:

Try: the code youâ€™d like to be executed and that could possibly throw an exception
Catch: the code that handles the exception if it is thrown
Finally: code that is executed regardless of whether an exception is thrown or now
