* HTTP requests

HTTP stands for hypertext transfer protocols, which is a protocol used between web servers or browsers. When a client sends a request to a server, the request returns a response.

There are 3 parts of an HTTP request:
*
1) Request line, which contains:
    a) Request method (ie GET, POST)
    b) The URL of the resource being requested
    c) The HTTP version being used
2) Request Header: provides more information about the request
3) Request body (optional)-contains data that is being sent with the request such as JSON

There are 3 parts of an HTTP response:
1) Status line that contains the status code
2) Response headers: provides additional information about th response
3) Response body: contains actual data being returned, ie JSON, HTML, an image
