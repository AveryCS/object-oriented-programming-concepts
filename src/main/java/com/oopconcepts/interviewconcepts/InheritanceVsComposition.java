/*
* Inheritance vs. Composition
Composition and inheritance are two mechanisms  used in OOP to create new classes, using other classes. Composition  can be seen through the “Has-A” relationship, while Inheritance can be seen through the “Is-A” relationship. The keywords for inheritance are implements and extends.
*
* Key Interview question:
Why is composition better than inheritance?
There is more flexibility with composition because you can change a variable or a method in a class, without making any changes to the superclass.
