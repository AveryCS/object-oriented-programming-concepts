/*RESTful routing is a pattern of creating API that map REST architecture to HTTP request methods. Each URL is known as an endpoint and specifies the resource name and its unique identifier.

For example, lets say we have an API for managing a collection of books. The endpoint might look like:

**The example below was copy/pasted from ChatGPT**

/books/123

where 123 is the unique identifier of the book in question.
Using RESTful routing, we can map HTTP request methods to specific CRUD operations on the /books resource. For example:
GET /books: Retrieve a list of all books
POST /books: Create a new book
GET /books/123: Retrieve the book with ID 123
PUT /books/123: Update the book with ID 123
DELETE /books/123: Delete the book with ID 123
